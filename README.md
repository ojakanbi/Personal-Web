## Reflection

* If you had more time, what would you like to incorporate into your website? How would it improve the user‚Äôs experience? What challenges would you anticipate when trying to implement the feature?
 I enjoyed creating this website, but with limited time, I would have liked to add more accessibility features to make it more mobile-friendly through the proper use of flexbox. I would also love to incorporate interactive sections, such as a contact form or direct messaging, to enhance user engagement. Additionally, I find hover effects visually appealing, so incorporating those into the design would be a priority for me.
The biggest challenge I anticipate when implementing these changes is time management. Building a basic website took some effort and required me to learn as I went. Adding new and more complex features will certainly require additional time, but I am confident that my skills will improve as I continue to work on this project. Another challenge I encountered during the creation of this website was screen compatibility; the website appeared differently on my laptop and tablet. To overcome this, I had to use the developer tools on the web to ensure it looked consistent on various devices.

  
* Why do you think web accessibility is important, and why did you choose your specific features to include?
  Web accessibility is crucial because it guarantees that everyone, regardless of capabilities, has access to the data and services offered by a website. Because accessible websites tend to be more logical, useful, and user-friendly, this not only helps persons with disabilities but also enhances the user experience for everyone.
   Including alternative text and captions for my interview video is an important aspect of web accessibility. By providing a text description, I am ensuring that people who are visually impaired or have difficulty hearing can still understand the content of the video. Additionally, including captions allows users who may be in a noisy environment or who have difficulty hearing to still consume the content. This consideration for all users, regardless of their abilities, makes my website more inclusive and accessible to a wider range of people, which ultimately enhances the user experience for everyone.
